# Multi-class Classification with Neural Networks
Implementation one-vs-all logistic regression with neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
In this project we will implement one-vs-all logistic regression with neural networks to recognize hand-written digits. 
The project is an exercise from the ["Machine Learning" course from Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) .

The implementation was done using GNU Octave. We will start with the scripts `ex3.m` and `ex3_nn.m`.
These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions that we will write in separate `*.m` files.
